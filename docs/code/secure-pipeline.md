# Secure Pipeline
{: .no_toc }



A secure pipeline is a set of processes and tools used to build, test, and deploy software in a way that prioritizes security at every stage of the development lifecycle. The goal of a secure pipeline is to ensure that applications are thoroughly tested for security vulnerabilities and compliance with security standards before they are released into production.


A secure pipeline typically involves the following stages:

1. Source Code Management: Developers use source code management tools, such as Git or SVN, to manage the code for the application.

2. Build: The application code is built into executable code using a build tool, such as Maven or Gradle.

3. Static Analysis: A static analysis tool, such as a SAST tool, is used to scan the code for security vulnerabilities.

4. Unit Testing: Developers write unit tests to ensure that the application functions as expected and to catch any bugs or errors.

5. Dynamic Analysis: A dynamic analysis tool, such as a DAST tool, is used to test the application in a running environment and identify any security vulnerabilities.

6. Artifact Repository: The application and all its dependencies are stored in an artifact repository, such as JFrog or Nexus.

7. Staging Environment: The application is deployed to a staging environment for further testing and validation.

8. Compliance Check: A compliance tool is used to check that the application meets any regulatory or compliance requirements.

9. Approval: The application is reviewed and approved for deployment to production.

10. Deployment: The application is deployed to production using a deployment tool, such as Ansible or Kubernetes.

By implementing a secure pipeline, organizations can ensure that their applications are thoroughly tested for security vulnerabilities and compliance with security standards, reducing the risk of security breaches and ensuring that applications are more resilient to attacks.






Step 1: Set up version control

* Use a version control system (VCS) such as Git to manage your application code.
* Store your code in a private repository and limit access to authorized users.
* Use strong authentication and authorization controls to secure access to your repository.

Step 2: Implement continuous integration

* Use a continuous integration (CI) tool such as Jenkins or Travis CI to automate your build process.
* Ensure that your CI tool is running in a secure environment.
* Use containerization to isolate your build environment and prevent dependencies from conflicting with each other.

Step 3: Perform automated security testing

* Use SAST, DAST, and SCA tools to perform automated security testing on your application code.
* Integrate these tools into your CI pipeline so that security testing is performed automatically with each build.
* Configure the tools to report any security issues and fail the build if critical vulnerabilities are found.

Step 4: Implement continuous deployment

* Use a continuous deployment (CD) tool such as Kubernetes or AWS CodeDeploy to automate your deployment process.
* Implement a release process that includes thorough testing and review to ensure that only secure and stable code is deployed.

Step 5: Monitor and respond to security threats

* Implement security monitoring tools to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.
* Use tools such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) systems to monitor your infrastructure and applications.
* Implement a security incident response plan to quickly respond to any security incidents that are detected.

          password: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_SERVER_PASSWORD }}
          script: |
            docker pull myapp:latest
            docker stop myapp || true
            docker rm myapp || true

```



In this example, the YAML file defines a CI/CD pipeline with four stages: build, test, security-test, and deploy. Each stage has a job that performs a specific set of tasks. The `build` job builds a Docker image for the application, the `test` job runs unit and integration tests, the `security-test` job performs automated security testing using SAST, DAST, and SCA tools, and the `deploy` job deploys the application to the production environment.

Each job is defined with a `runs-on` parameter that specifies the operating system that the job should run on. The steps for each job are defined with `name` and `run` parameters that specify the name of the step and the command to run. The `uses` parameter is used to specify external actions or packages that should be used in the step.

The `if` parameter is used to conditionally run a job based on a specific condition, such as the branch or tag that triggered the pipeline. Secrets are stored in the GitHub repository's secrets store and accessed using the `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` syntax.
