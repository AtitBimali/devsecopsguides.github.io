<span class="d-inline-block p-2 mr-1 v-align-middle bg-red-000"></span>Noncompliant code:


```java
// Noncompliant code
NSString *input = [request parameterForKey:@"input"];
NSLog(@"Processing input: %@", input);
// Process the input without any validation or sanitization
```

In this noncompliant code, the input variable is obtained from a request object without any validation or sanitization. This code is vulnerable to various security risks, such as injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Attackers can manipulate the input to execute malicious code or access sensitive information.









<span class="d-inline-block p-2 mr-1 v-align-middle bg-green-000"></span>Compliant code:


```java
// Compliant code
NSString *input = [request parameterForKey:@"input"];
NSCharacterSet *allowedCharacterSet = [NSCharacterSet alphanumericCharacterSet];
NSString *sanitizedInput = [[input componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet:[allowedCharacterSet invertedSet]] componentsJoinedByString:@""];
NSLog(@"Processing input: %@", sanitizedInput);
// Process the sanitized input
```


In the compliant code, the input variable is sanitized by removing any characters that are not alphanumeric. This is achieved by using NSCharacterSet to define the allowed character set and filtering out the characters that are not part of the set. By sanitizing the input before processing it, you reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities.


It's important to note that input sanitization requirements can vary depending on the specific use case and context. The example above provides a basic approach to sanitizing input, but it might not be sufficient for all scenarios. Depending on the desired input restrictions, you might need to employ more sophisticated techniques or use specialized libraries for input validation and sanitization.

Additional security measures you can implement to address vulnerabilities in Objective-C include:

* Using parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* Applying proper input validation based on expected data types, formats, or ranges.
* Utilizing encryption libraries or frameworks to protect sensitive data at rest or in transit.
* Implementing access controls and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive operations or resources.

By applying these security measures and following best practices, you can mitigate vulnerabilities in Objective-C and enhance the overall security of your application.
