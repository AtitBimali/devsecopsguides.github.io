# Threat Intelligence
{: .no_toc }

Threat intelligence is the process of gathering and analyzing information about potential and existing cybersecurity threats, such as malware, phishing attacks, and data breaches. The goal of threat intelligence is to provide organizations with actionable insights that can help them identify and mitigate potential security risks before they can cause harm.

In the context of DevSecOps, threat intelligence is an important component of a comprehensive security strategy. By gathering and analyzing information about potential security threats, organizations can better understand the security risks that they face and take steps to mitigate them. This can include implementing security controls and countermeasures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems, to protect against known threats.

Threat intelligence can also be used to enhance other DevSecOps practices, such as vulnerability management and incident response. By identifying potential vulnerabilities and threats in real-time, security teams can take swift action to remediate issues and prevent security incidents from occurring.

Some of the key benefits of threat intelligence in DevSecOps include:

1. Improved threat detection: Threat intelligence provides organizations with the information they need to detect potential security threats before they can cause harm.

2. Better decision-making: By providing actionable insights, threat intelligence helps organizations make informed decisions about their security posture and response to potential threats.

3. Proactive threat mitigation: Threat intelligence enables organizations to take a proactive approach to threat mitigation, allowing them to stay ahead of emerging threats and reduce their risk of being compromised.

4. Enhanced incident response: Threat intelligence can be used to enhance incident response, allowing organizations to quickly and effectively respond to security incidents and minimize their impact.
