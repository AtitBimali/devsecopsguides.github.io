# Model Robustness and Adversarial Attacks
{: .no_toc }



Assessing and improving the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. This involves testing models against various adversarial scenarios, developing defenses to mitigate attacks (e.g., adversarial training), and understanding the limitations of model robustness.



## OWASP Machine Learning Security Verification Standard (MLSVS)


1- Familiarize with MLSVS  

Read the MLSVS documentation available on the OWASP website.

2- Assess Threat Model

Conduct a threat modeling exercise to identify potential security risks and threats in your machine learning system.

3- Verify Model Training Data  Perform data validation and integrity checks on the training dataset to ensure its quality and prevent adversarial tampering.

4- Verify Model Training Process Validate the security measures implemented during the model training process, such as access controls, versioning, and secure storage.

5- Evaluate Model Robustness Test the model against various attack techniques, such as evasion attacks, poisoning attacks, and adversarial inputs, to assess its resilience.

6- Verify Model Explanations Validate the interpretability and explainability of the model's predictions to ensure transparency and accountability.

7- Assess Model Deployment Security  Evaluate the security controls implemented during the deployment of the machine learning model, including access controls, authentication, and encryption.

8- Monitor Model Performance Establish monitoring mechanisms to detect and mitigate model performance degradation, data drift, and adversarial attacks in real-time.

9- Implement Privacy Protection  Apply privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy, anonymization, or federated learning, to protect sensitive data used in the machine learning system.

10- Regularly Update MLSVS Practices  Stay updated with the latest MLSVS guidelines and best practices to adapt to evolving machine learning security threats.
