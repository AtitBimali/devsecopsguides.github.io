# Model Robustness and Adversarial Attacks
{: .no_toc }



Assessing and improving the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. This involves testing models against various adversarial scenarios, developing defenses to mitigate attacks (e.g., adversarial training), and understanding the limitations of model robustness.
